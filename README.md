[Introduced a dataset based on the top 100 billboard songs] (https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017/workspace/file?filename=Hot+100+Audio+Features.xlsx)
Some potential uses of this data is understand trends in popular music, what kinds of genres are the most popular, what sounds (i.e. types of drum sounds, use of electronic effects, types of singing, etc) frequently show up in popular songs, and much more. This information could potentially be used by song writers who are looking to write the next hit for a pop singer.
[Introduction of _Fundamental Numerical Methods and Data Analysis _by George W. Collins, II, Harvard University) [https://ads.harvard.edu/books/1990fnmd.book/]
I am interested in this book because I want to learn the basics of data analysis. I feel that I lack the general background that data analysts or maybe even statisticians may have, so I'd like to learn more about the basics so I can apply them in my job.
